                            Welcome to my page! My name is Chelsey, and I'm glad that you spent sometime to get to know me a bit better. A little background on myself, I'm a mother of 2 children, wife, a position as a full time Customer Service Technical Specialist, and many many pets. No joke! After discovering a mutual love to saltwater aquariums with my spouse, we have 3 seprate aquariums (one of which is soley mine!). I also have 2 adorable French Bulldogs. <br>I think its save to say that I embrase choas daily!

                    Why create a webpage?

              <div id="flush-collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingOne" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
                <div class="accordion-body"><p>Well, I have always been the kind of person that desires to try new things and challenge myself to solve problems using any resources available. I currently work at a very fast growing IoT company for the past 6 years. Finding that being able to wear multiple different hats is sometimes necessary at any given time. Having been tossed into many different roles (often with no prior training or varying amounts of direction) I was able to grow my existing skillset and develop new talants that I didn't know I had!</p>
                <p>Semi-recently, I was placed in the postion of managing both an internal and external troubleshooting knowledge base, with no prior experience. I was terrified! The more I dug into the design and orginization of the existing content, the more lost I was! Hardly anything I did translated through the content managing system correctly. When I found suggestions on how to fix something, it referenced entering gibberish text in a HTML document, the Source Code of a certain page, or even editing the stylesheet. I knew that it was computer code of somekind,but there was no way I was confortable changing stuff in that!</p>
                <p>I spent several days reading, asking seamingly random questions to developers and app programmers, trying to grasp some level of understanding of computer code. I'm not going to lie, it was incredibly mundane and I was not happy with having to put so much effort into learning something people went to universities to get degrees in. However, when it was time to put all of my studing into action, it didn't work!</p>
                <p>Looking back on this, I can't help but laugh because I know that is the moment that sparked something within me. Eventually, I had to surender and pull in an expert to review the area I was tweaking. <strong>I was 1 little missing starting element!</strong> I was actually shocked that I was so close to successing. Also, I was incredibly impressed that it only took the person 30 seconds to locate the issue.</p>
                <p>Since then, I never stopped learning more about how the code worked with the system, and all the <strong>AMAZING</strong> things I could do using this new wealth know knowlege. I loved the feeling of accomplishing something that appeared so hard in just a short while. I got so engulfed in this new found power that I spent several days after working hours creating a completely new templete for the our external knowlege base, taking great care to brand it to the parent website and changing areas that had always bothered me. I really wanted visiters to the webpage to have a better experience and find what they needed intuitivly. I was so proud of the end result! In the end, the templete I customized didn't get published for various reasons.</p>
                <p>I know that this was an extremely long answer to 'Why create a webpage?', but I think it adiquity describes my journey to finding something that I just couldn't stop doing. Although, it might be more appropriate to say that this was my story on how I found the answer to the question repeatedly asked, <em>"What do you want to do when you grow up?"</em> I now know that I want to invest in my passion of computer coding, and specialize in any area that whispers to me.</p></div>
